# Next.js API Route 500 Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications:  poor handling of 500 errors originating from API routes.  The example shows an API route that might throw a database error. The frontend doesn't handle this scenario appropriately, leading to a generic error message.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` API route simulates a database error under a specific environment variable. When this error occurs, the application crashes without proper error handling on the client-side.

## Solution

The solution enhances error handling both on the server-side and client-side to provide a better user experience.  The server responds with more informative error messages, and the client gracefully handles these errors, preventing application crashes and providing feedback to the user.
